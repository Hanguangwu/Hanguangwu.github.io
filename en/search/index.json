[{"content":"Vector-based Drawing APP——Rnote Introduction GitHub-RNote\nRnote Official Website\nSketch and take handwritten notes.\nRnote is an open-source vector-based drawing app for sketching, handwritten notes and to annotate documents and pictures. It is targeted at students, teachers and those who own a drawing tablet and provides features like Pdf and picture import and export, an infinite canvas and an adaptive UI for big and small screens.\nWritten in Rust and GTK4.\nFeatures Adaptive UI focused on stylus input Pressure-sensitive stylus input with different and configurable stroke styles Create many different shapes with the shape tool Move, rotate, resize and modify existing content with the selection tool Different document expansion layouts ( fixed pages, continuous vertical, infinite in every direction, .. ) Customizable background colors, patterns, sizes Customizable page format (Optional) pen sounds Reconfigurable stylus button shortcuts An integrated workspace browser for quick access to related files Drag \u0026amp; Drop, clipboard support Pdf, Bitmap and Svg image import Documents can be exported to Svg, Pdf and Xopp. Document pages and selections to Svg, Png and Jpeg. Save and load the documents in the native .rnote file format Tabs to work on multiple documents at the same time Autosave, printing Disclaimer\nThe file format is still unstable. It might change and break compatibility between versions.\nInstallation Linux Download the official flatpak on Flathub here.\nMacOS Thanks to dehesselle the app is available on MacOS as an app bundle.\nCheck out the repository, the latest release can be downloaded here.\nWindows Download the Windows installer from the latest release which can be found here.\nInstall using Winget:\n1 winget install flxzt.rnote Downgrading Because the file format still is unstable, downgrading to a specific version might be necessary.\nList all available past versions on flathub:\n1 flatpak remote-info --log flathub com.github.flxzt.rnote Pick the commit from the desired version and downgrade with:\n1 sudo flatpak update --commit=\u0026lt;commit-hash\u0026gt; com.github.flxzt.rnote After downgrading, the flatpak version can be pinned or unpinned with:\n1 2 $ flatpak mask com.github.flxzt.rnote $ flatpak mask --remove com.github.flxzt.rnote To update to the latest version again, unpin and run flatpak update.\nScreenshots Pitfalls \u0026amp; Known Issues Drag \u0026amp; Drop not working -\nMake sure Rnote has permissions to the locations you are dragging files from. Can be granted in Flatseal (a Flatpak permissions manager)\nOdd location for current file -\nWhen the directory displayed in the header title is something like /run/user/1000/../, rnote does not have permissions to access the directory. Again, granting them in Flatseal fixes this issue.\nStylus buttons move canvas / are not functional -\nMake sure that the xf86-input-wacom, drivers on X11 and libinput on Wayland and libwacom are installed and loaded.\nWhile hovering with the stylus, other input events are blocked in some regions of the screen -\nSupposed to be palm rejection, but might be undesirable. If there is a left- / righthanded system tablet setting, make sure it is set correctly. Rnote can\u0026rsquo;t disable this unfortunately. ( discussed in issue #329 )\nOne of the stylus buttons shortcut mapping does not work as intended -\nOn some devices one stylus button is mapped to a dedicated \u0026ldquo;Eraser\u0026rdquo; mode (which is the back-side on other styli). The buttons in the shortcuts settings could then be inconsistent ( the secondary / upper button is actually the primary / lower button , or reverse ). To change the tool that is mapped to this \u0026ldquo;Eraser\u0026rdquo; mode, do the following:\nHover over the canvas, and press and hold the button that is suspected to be mapped to the \u0026ldquo;Eraser\u0026rdquo; mode Switch to the desired pen style while keeping the button pressed When releasing the pressed button, it should switch back to the previous pen style The pen style in the \u0026ldquo;Eraser\u0026rdquo; mode should now be remembered Translations If you want to start contributing by translating, take a look into the translations section of the CONTRIBUTING document.\nFonts The following fonts are bundled with the application:\nGrape Nuts: Grape Nuts is a simple handwritten casual font. OpenDyslexic-Regular: OpenDyslexic is a typeface designed against some common symptoms of dyslexia. TT2020Base-Regular: TT2020 is an advanced, open source, hyperrealistic, multilingual typewriter font for a new decade. Virgil: The font that powers Excalidraw. File Format The .rnote file format is a gzipped json file.\nSo far breaking changes in the format happened in versions:\nv0.2.0 v0.3.0 v0.4.0 v0.5.0 To be able to open and export older files that are incompatible with the newest version, look under Installation /Downgrading to install older versions of Rnote.\nLicense Rnote is available under GPL-3.0-or-later.

Just as authors sometimes have \u0026ldquo;writers block\u0026rdquo; it\u0026rsquo;s also true for developers. This list is intended to solve this issue once and for all! 👍\nThese applications are:\ngreat for improving your coding skills 💪; great for experimenting with new technologies 🆕; great for adding to your portfolio to impress your next employer/client 📁; great for using as examples in tutorials (articles or videos) 📃; easy to complete and also easily extendable with new features 👌; This is not just a simple list of projects, but a collection that describes each project in enough detail so that you can develop it from the ground up!\nEach project has the following features:\nA clear and descriptive objective; A list of User Stories which should be implemented (these stories act more as a guideline than a forced list of To-Do\u0026rsquo;s. Feel free to add your own stories if you want); A list of bonus features that not only improve the base project, but also your skills at the same time (these are optional and should be attempted only after you have completed the required user stories) All the resources and links to help you find what you need to complete the project Here you can watch a video about this repository.\nProjects Projects are divided into three tiers based on the knowledge and experience required to complete them.\nTier Developer Profile 1 Developers in the early stages of their learning journey. Those who are typically focused on creating user-facing applications. 2 Developers at an intermediate stage of learning and experience. They are comfortable in UI/UX, using development tools, and building apps that use API services. 3 Developers who have all of the above, and are learning more advanced techniques like implementing backend applications and database services. 🌟 - New Project\nTier-1: Beginner Projects Name Short Description Tier Bin2Dec Binary-to-Decimal number converter 1-Beginner Border Radius Previewer Preview
