**Step 5**: Wait until you see the Activation tool.  
  
**Step 6**: To select what you want to activate, just press the number on your keyboard..

### Method 2 - Traditional (Windows Vista and later)


1. Download the script: [**MAS_AIO.cmd**](https://dev.azure.com/massgrave/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts/_apis/git/repositories/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts/items?path=/MAS/All-In-One-Version-KL/MAS_AIO.cmd&download=true) or the [full ZIP](https://dev.azure.com/massgrave/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts/_apis/git/repositories/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts/items?$format=zip).

Tip

- Some ISPs/DNS block access to our domains. You can bypass this by enabling [DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/encrypted-dns-browsers/) in your browser.
- **Having trouble**❓Visit our [troubleshooting page](https://massgrave.dev/troubleshoot) or raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts/issues).

- To activate additional products such as **Office for macOS, Visual Studio, RDS CALs, and Windows XP**, check [here](https://massgrave.dev/unsupported_products_activation).
- To run the scripts in unattended mode, check [here](https://massgrave.dev/command_line_switches).

Note

- The IRM command in PowerShell downloads a script from a specified URL, and the IEX command executes it.
- Always double-check the URL before executing the command and verify the source if manually downloading files.
- Be cautious, as some spread malware disguised as MAS by using different URLs in the IRM command.
